A GPA (Grade Point Average) Calculator is a practical tool that many students find helpful for managing their academic progress. It allows users to input their course information and grades, perform grade conversions, and calculate their GPA and CGPA.

Title: GPA Calculator

Description:
Welcome to the GPA Calculator, a versatile tool designed to assist students in calculating their Grade Point Average (GPA) and Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). This application streamlines the process of tracking academic performance, converting grades, and generating insightful tabular information.

Key Features and Components:

1. **Course Information Entry**: Users can input essential details for each course, including the course name, course code, credit hours, and the obtained grade.

2. **Grade Conversion**: The GPA Calculator incorporates a grade conversion mechanism that converts letter grades to their respective grade points. This enables accurate GPA calculation based on the institution's grading scale.

3. **GPA Calculation**: Users can calculate their semester GPA by summing the products of course credit hours and corresponding grade points, then dividing by the total credit hours. The calculated GPA is displayed with a clear indication of the achieved academic performance.

4. **Cumulative GPA (CGPA) Calculation**: In addition to semester GPA, users can calculate their CGPA by considering the cumulative credit hours and cumulative grade points earned across multiple semesters. The CGPA provides an overview of the student's overall academic progress.

5. **Grade Scale Information**: The application provides users with a reference to the grading scale used for conversions, ensuring transparency and clarity in the calculation process.

6. **Tabular Presentation**: The GPA Calculator generates a tabular representation of course details, grades, credit hours, grade points, and calculated GPA. The tabular layout facilitates quick and easy comprehension of the academic data.

7. **User-friendly Interface**: The user interface is designed for ease of use, with intuitive input fields, calculation buttons, and informative output areas.

8. **Data Persistence**: The calculator may include the option to save and load previous semester data, allowing users to keep track of their academic progress over time.

9. **Help and Documentation**: Provide clear instructions and guidance on using the GPA Calculator, explaining the input requirements, calculation process, and interpretation of results.

10. **Contribution and Enhancement**: Encourage contributors to improve and expand the calculator's features, documentation, and user interface, creating a collaborative learning environment.

Project Structure:

- **Input Forms**: Develop forms for users to input course information and grades.

- **Calculation Logic**: Implement algorithms for grade conversion, GPA, and CGPA calculations.

- **Tabular Display**: Design a layout for displaying course details, grades, and calculated GPAs in a clear and organized table.

- **Data Storage (Optional)**: Include functionality to save and load semester data for future reference.

- **Documentation**: Provide a comprehensive guide on using the GPA Calculator and contributing to the project.
